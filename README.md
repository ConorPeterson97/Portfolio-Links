# Dashingers
Dashingers is a rhythm/bullet hell game made for Microsoft's Game Camp.
The Gameplay is best played on a touch screen where the character will 
follow the user's touch allowing them to avoid obstacles.
The defining feature of the game is the 'dash' mechanic where a player
can tap an area that is far away from the character, and they 'dash' to that
point, attacking enemies along the way.
My role on the team was concepting the dash mechanic and programming the 
logic for spawning the enemies in the level.

# Swinging Multiplayer VR Shooter
This game was a part of a VR project with the goal of making a multiplayer game
with a form of locomotion. I chose to make a swinging mechanic based on Spider-Man.
The right hand would control your 'webs' for swinging and the left hand would 'shoot'.
The goal was to shoot more of the green boxes than your opponent before all were shot.
The physics needed to be hard-coded as Unity's built in physics did not account for 
the pendulum-based physics that I was attempting.
